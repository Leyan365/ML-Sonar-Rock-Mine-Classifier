# Sonar-Rock-Mine-Classifier üì°

## Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to classify underwater **sonar returns** as either a **Rock (R)** or an **Explosive Mine (M)**. The core of the system is a highly optimized **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model, deployed via a high-fidelity, command-center-style web application built using **Streamlit**.

The application prioritizes **safety** by maximizing the detection of the critical "Mine" class.

## üöÄ The Sonar Classification Application

The Streamlit application simulates a submarine's sonar analysis console. Users can select pre-loaded sonar data and instantly see the model's classification, confidence level, threat assessment, and corresponding tactical recommendations.

## üß† Machine Learning Model Details

The model was trained on the **Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks** dataset, which consists of 60 normalized energy features from sonar signals.

### ‚úÖ Final Model Selection and Conclusion

The classification task is highly sensitive, where missing a Mine (False Negative) is much more costly than falsely identifying a Rock as a Mine (False Positive). The **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** was chosen for its superior performance, particularly its perfect recall for the critical Mine class.

#### üìä Cross-Validation Comparison

The Cross-Validation (CV) scores provide the most reliable estimate of real-world performance, indicating the **Tuned SVM** as the clear winner:

| **Model** | **Best CV Accuracy** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tuned SVM** | **87.13%** |
| Tuned Random Forest | 82.98% |
| Tuned Logistic Regression | 77.08% |

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Tuned SVM Evaluation Summary

| **Metric** | **Score** | **Insight** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best Reliable Accuracy (CV)** | **87.13%** | The most trustworthy estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. |
| **Test Accuracy** | **85.71%** | Confirms strong generalization on the small held-out test set. |
| **Mine (M) Recall** | **1.00 (100%)** | **No false negatives** ‚Äî all actual mines were correctly identified. **Critical for safety-sensitive tasks.** |
| **Mine (M) Precision** | **0.79** | Of all predicted "Mine" instances, 79% were correct. (Acceptable trade-off for 100% Recall). |

> **Conclusion:** This model is both **accurate and safe**, making it the best choice for reliable classification in sonar-based mine detection.
